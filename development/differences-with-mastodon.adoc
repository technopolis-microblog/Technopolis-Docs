= Differences with Mastodon

The Technopolis API is basically compatible with the Mastodon API, but some features do not exist in Mastodon or may not work properly due to differences in specifications.

Also, **The Technopolis API is not compatible with the Misskey API.** For this reason, the Misskey client cannot be used with Technopolis.
